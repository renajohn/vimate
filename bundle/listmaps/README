:verbose set <option> will tell you where an option was set.
Unfortunately it's not so easy to find out where a map was
defined.

This script will open a new window with a list of
all sourced scripts. If maps are defined in the script then
they will list below the script name. Initially this will
appear folded.

You can then inspect the maps in a script or search for a
map to find out where it was defined. 

To use

   :Listmaps

It pulls out just about anything that looks like it might be
a map for completeness. There will be a few a lines that the
script mistakes for a map, but which aren't. And it may be a
little slow.
