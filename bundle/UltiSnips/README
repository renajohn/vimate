This is the initial release of UltiSnips. It is the Ultimate solution for snippets under Vim. Snippets are intelligent text that spares you a lot of typing. Like many snippets solutions, this one ins heavily inspired by TextMates Snippet Syntax and offers all features that TextMate offers. But in Vim.

This release features the following features:

- TextMates snippet syntax
- Tabstops, Placeholders (also nested)
- Mirrors and Transformations (also inside Placeholders)
- ShellCode, VimCode and a very powerful PythonCode interpolation
- Live update as you type
- snippets for file types and snippets that are always defined
- same name, multiple snippets
- recursive snippets: snippet in snippet
- forward and backward jumping to placeholders and tab stops
- convert script to download and convert TM bundles
- > 150 unit tests to guarantee that stuff works.
- Tested on Linux and Mac OS X

There have been many attempts to do things right; I think, this one nails it. 

Try it:
Example 1:
- open /tmp/file.c
type for<tab>endcounter<c-j>mycounter<c-j><c-j>int a = 3;
yields:
------------------- SNIP -------------------
for(size_t mycounter = 0; mycounter < endcounter; ++mycounter)
{
	int a = 3;
}
------------------- SNAP -------------------

Example 2:
- open /tmp/blah.help
- :set ft=help
- type sec<tab>MY COOL SECTION<c-h>blah
yields:
------------------- SNIP -------------------
=============================================================================
MY COOL SECTION                                        *blah-my-cool-section*

blah
------------------- SNAP -------------------
